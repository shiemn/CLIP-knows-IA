# Overview

The following files can be used to perform the same experiments as in Section 4.1 of the paper:

We mainly use PyTorch and scikit-learn for these experiments. All necessary requirements are also listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

Before you can use the following file, you first have to embedd the images of the AVA Dataset using one of the scripts provided in the [LinearRegression Directory](../Linear-Regression/).

**`regression.ipynb`**:

After creating the embedding files using the previously mentioned scripts, you can use this short notebook to perform Zero-shot experiments and evaluate the performance of Prompting on the AVA Dataset.
