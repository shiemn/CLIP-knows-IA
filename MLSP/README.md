**`ava-mlsp/`**:

In this folder we provide the source code for the MLSP method, which has been adapted to run using TensorFlow2 and Python3. For more information on the code see the original implementation at https://github.com/subpic/ava-mlsp 

**`our_split_valid.csv'`**:

This file contains the same split used by us for the rest of the experiments, in the format required by the MLSP method.
